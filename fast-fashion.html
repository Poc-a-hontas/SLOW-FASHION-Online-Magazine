                <p class="ff-article-1">Not sure about the definition of fast fashion? Cheap and trending clothes that get <br> 
                    produced rapidly and in a huge amount. Basically, the idea behind it is to get the newest <br>
                    trends from catwalks to the people in as little time as possible. Sadly, we are still living <br>
                    in a world where wearing the same piece of clothes repeatedly is considered a faux-pas, <br>
                    therefore we are somewhat pressured to buy new clothes very often and throw them away <br>
                    after just a few times of wearing it, also known  as a ‘throw-away culture’. Sick, I know.

                    <h2> THE TRUE COST</h2> 
                    <p class="ff-article-2">
                            About the equivalent of one truck full of clothes is being <br>
                            burned or dumped in a landfill every single second. <br>
                            Moreover, fashion industry is the second largest polluter <br>
                        of clean water globally (right after agriculture). <br>
                        
                            Brands such as H&M or Zara very often use cheap labour <br>
                        in order to reduce the cost and that way gain more profit. <br>
                        These workers work for very little money, in dangerous environments <br>
                            as they are in a direct contact with toxic elements, <br>
                            with no human rights whatsoever. So next time you go to a mall, <br>
                        ask yourself twice whether you need a new T-shirt for such cost. <br>
                        <br> <br>

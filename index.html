                Hey-lo there, <br>
                Katerina here. <br>
                        
                In a way, I am a minimalist. I basically <br>
                own two things only: <br>
                an empty wallet and a head full of ideas. <br>
                And that’s all I need really. <br>
                        
                At this very moment, over 98% of my wardrobe <br>
                is second-handed (third-handed usually hahah). <br>
                And I want nothing but to inspire you to do the same. <br>
                To show you it is very much possible and affordable. <br>
                And to prove that old stuff are awesome and deserve <br>
                a second chance. <br>    
                    </p>

                <p class="home-article">
                      
                There was one moment in the fashion industry that <br>
                made me want to be part of it. <br>
                It was during Prague Fashion Week in 2019, <br>
                when a Czech fashion designer Iva Burketová <br>
                sent naked models on stage to start a debate about <br>
                sustainability and the fake world of fashion. <br>
                I figured out that to fix a problem, one cannot <br>
                only stand, one has to act. <br>
                
                Therefore, in the future, I am aiming to create <br>
                a fashion brand that will be 100% sustainable <br>
                Because I truly believe that there is no need <br>
                to produce any more clothing, <br>
                the only way to go is by reusing the tons <br>
                of materials that already exist. <br>
                    
                </p>
